# How to import certs into the keystore! (And why you should) (SSL 101)

# Did you get this error when developing? :

# sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target


# The answer is simple: We're using a custom truststore here and the truststore doesn't have the cert path you need.
# You need to download the certificates (you can use Google Chrome) and import them into this here truststore
